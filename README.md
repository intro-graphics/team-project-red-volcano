# team-project-red-volcano

# What It Is:
In this project, we have created a volcano model that you can interact with it in many ways. You can turn on or off the smoke by using a button. Furthermore,  you have the ability to move a rainy cloud to remove the smoke particles from the top of the volcano.
# What We Did:
For creating good looking objects, we have used blender in many parts of the projects. We have tried to make it more realistic by using a particle system for creating the smoke effect and raindrops. Also, we have used a basic collision detection to detect the contact of smoke particles and the cloud.
# How To Run It:
You can run this project by using host.bat or host.command file. However, if you don't want to use them you can run the localhost:8000 on your browser.
